                  <div class="discriptionfull" style="display:none;">
                    <p>While most companies understand that traditional marketing strategies no longer are effective in
                      today's market, few marketing teams really grasp the importance of inbound marketing. Due to how
                      society consumes media of all forms, inbound marketing can launch your company to the forefront of
                      advertising and convert leads into sales. However, this is nearly impossible with traditional
                      marketing methods; the return on investment for traditional advertising sinks every year. To keep
                      up with today's market, companies must invest in valid inbound marketing strategies. Why?</p>
                    <p>Inbound marketing appeals to and works with the way we consume media in this day and age.
                      According to <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing">HubSpot</a>, this form of
                      marketing focuses on attracting customers through relevant media while not interrupting their
                      browsing experience. With the invention of ad blockers, internet users today have little patience
                      for anything that interrupts them; an ill-placed advertisement is more likely to turn people away
                      from your company than make them look into it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>Why Outsourcing Inbound Marketing Equals Smart Investing</h5>
                    <p>When considering inbound marketing, content is king. Forbes states "<a
                        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/18/inbound-marketing-how-to-provide-more-value-for-consumers-and-drive-more-traffic/#29236d0a1a89">inbound
                        marketing is only as strong as the content you're creating and its relevance to your target
                        audience</a>," highlighting the fact that bad inbound marketing is just as devastating as good
                      traditional marketing. Both are ineffective in today's world.</p>
                    <p>Brands are learning the value of cultivating relationships with their consumers. For example,
                      many people are die-hard Apple or Samsung fans when it comes to their smartphones, largely due to
                      the brand loyalty those two companies built early on. A successful inbound marketing campaign can
                      build a strong brand-consumer relationship, as evidenced by&nbsp;<strong><a
                          href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics#get-the-report">HubSpot's 9th Annual Report
                          on the Future of Inbound Marketing and Sales</a></strong>. Of all the marketing techniques
                      used today, inbound marketing that focuses on quality content and correctly targets different
                      demographics with the appropriate methodology results in increased sales and shows a greater
                      return on investment.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>How To Choose The Right Outsourcing Agent</h5>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, content matters when it comes to inbound marketing. If your content
                      falls flat by failing to reach your target audience or by being irrelevant, it will prove
                      ineffective. This would be similar to trying to reach millennials by posting advertisements in the
                      Yellow Pages section of your local phone book. Producing quality content on your own can be
                      difficult at best, and even more challenging when you need to tailor that content to different
                      demographics, stay on top of current trends, and consistently produce new content on a regular
                      basis. Many companies instead choose to hire professionals, outsourcing their inbound marketing
                      needs.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In order to get quality content from an outsourcing agent, <a
                        href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/09/13/six-key-elements-of-an-effective-inbound-marketing-strategy/#3c93bc83326f">Forbes</a>
                      recommends looking for a fusion of:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>search engine optimization,</li>
                      <li>social media,</li>
                      <li>pay-per-click marketing,</li>
                      <li>relevant landing pages,</li>
                      <li>content creation, and</li>
                      <li>email marketing.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>While several of these things appear like traditional marketing techniques, they look different
                      today. Combining all six elements means you cover all demographics and are able to amplify the
                      content you create. For example, blog posts that successfully utilize search engine optimization
                      will show up on Google searches, which can be shared via social media by those who find the
                      content useful; many advertisers use this technique today by offering a share button through
                      Facebook, Email, and Twitter. That same post can also be sent to your email marketing subscribers
                      or those who follow your social media accounts. Prioritize a company than can successfully
                      integrate all marketing angles while leading your brand followers by producing&nbsp;<a

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has been a gift for those who want to market their
                      business and it seems logical that if you are selling or promoting something you want it on as
                      many websites as possible. In many industries, including real estate, this includes relying on
                      third-party syndication. You list a home and then send it to Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, etc. Is
                      this always the best approach? Yes, you get your listing out there, but you haven't done anything
                      to build your brand. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">To be successful in the long term as
                      a real estate agent, you must focus on local branding and have a solid digital marketing plan in
                      place. You won't see results overnight, but if you put in the sweat equity and implement
                      consistent marketing strategies, you will reap the rewards. Here are digital marketing strategies
                      and best practices to help you build your brand and help you sell homes, even when the market
                      slows:</span>
                    <h5><strong>Make Your Website Mobile-Friendly</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a given that in today's business climate you have a
                      professional website, but you need to take it further by making sure that potential clients can
                      browse listings from their phone and/or tablet. Studies have shown that 80% of consumers use their
                      mobile devices for online browsing and purchasing. Take advantage of this by making your website
                      readable on all types of devices, using a responsive website design.'</span>
                    <h5><strong>Use a Matterport 3D Camera or Hire a Matterport Professional</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional photos, panoramic views, and virtual tours for real
                      estate listings are a must, but consider moving beyond these and embracing the latest technology
                      to truly set yourself apart from the crowd. A Matterport 3D camera scans the inside of a home and
                      puts the pieces together so potential buyers can take a virtual tour. This isn't your standard
                      virtual tour, but one that a buyer can walk through in virtual reality.</span>
                    <h5><strong>Ramp Up Your Social Media Presence</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an agent and you aren't on Instagram, Pinterest,
                      Facebook, and Twitter, you will never get the engagement that you need to be successful in the
                      long run. A long time ago, word of mouth used to be the best way to make something go viral and
                      build a strong reputation. We have now moved into the technological era of social proof. When
                      someone is looking for a contractor, an agent, a lawyer, or any type of service they go on social
                      media and ask for a recommendation. If you have a strong social media presence, you will be the
                      go-to agent for friends, family, and those who have already done business with you.</span>
                    <h5><strong>Inspire Engagement with Awesome Content</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Having social media accounts and a professional website does nothing
                      to build your brand if you aren't adding content that makes potential buyers and sellers want to
                      engage with you. You can post listings, but don't give away the farm&mdash;instead, post teasers
                      that include a few pictures and limited facts. If someone is browsing and they want all of the
                      information, build in a form asking for an email and/or phone number that you can add to a
                      marketing list. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you can use the Matterhorn stuff, but
                      don't be afraid to take selfies and make your own walk-through videos with your cell phone. Also,
                      create a blog to inspire engagement&mdash;you can cover useful topics like tips for first-time
                      home buyers and sellers, neighborhood guides, and decorating ideas. If you are going to be on six
                      to eight different platforms, make sure they are building your brand. Syndicate yourself, instead
                      of putting things on Zillow, Trulia, etc.</span>
                    <h5><strong>Use Listing-Specific Websites</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlight your properties by dedicating an entire website to each of
                      them. These single-property websites, also called listing-specific websites, allow you to showcase
                      each property and pack it with more and better information than what you can find on the MLS. Once
                      you have a dedicated web address, which is usually the street address, you can fill the site with
                      information that includes property details, a virtual tour, videos, seller information, area map,
                      MLS info, listing data, a printable brochure. You can then use the domain in newspapers,
                      magazines, rider signs, and social media sites to attract people to the site.</span>
                    <h5><strong>Add Social Sharing to All of Your Content</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it's a single-property website, a blog post, an Instagram
                      video, or property photos, add social sharing to all of your content. Make it easy for potential
                      home buyers to share things with friends and family or for a really great blog post to go
                      viral.</span>
                    <h5><strong>Optimize Your Website and Blog</strong></h5>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Real Estate SEO is difficult and it requires patience and
                      persistence, but if you take the time, the rewards outweigh the costs by a bazillion. The
                      underlying philosophy is this: you use tools on and off of your website that lets Google know your
                      website content. The better you become at "speaking" to Google, the more visitors Google sends
                      your way. Internal linking is the most important part of real estate SEO. </span> <span
                      style="font-weight: 400;">You should aim to link to 3-5 other internal web pages or blog posts in
                      every longer piece of content that you write. If you use neighborhood pages as anchors, you can
                      link any new content that you write to those pages. Further, make sure that you link deeper by
                      linking to your oldest content page. You should avoid linking to your homepage and your contact
                      page.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Technology has made a significant impact on the real
                      estate market. Social media platforms have changed the way that real estate agents and brokers
                      reach potential clients. Companies must be more interactive with their audience. Some think they
                      can throw up a basic website with a few listings and this will be enough, but in this day in age,
                      you have to do better if you want to go far. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you

                      requires consistency. Your persistence and hard work will be rewarded if you stick with it. If

                  <div class="discriptionfull" style="display:none;">
                    <p>Every business owner wants to grow their company and attract new customers. In order to build and
                      maintain market share, it's important to reach your customers and clients where they are&mdash;and
                      where they are is online. That's why digital marketing is a critical part of your overall
                      marketing strategy.</p>
                    <h5>The Importance of Digital Marketing</h5>
                    <p>In today's world, digital marketing is more important than ever. Studies show that more and more
                      consumers rely on Internet research and social media to make purchasing decisions.</p>
                    <p>Digital marketing carries many advantages.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>A wide reach.</strong> Online marketing lets you reach out to any audience, regardless
                        of distance.</li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Build relationships with customers and clients. </strong>Digital marketing gives you a
                        platform to stay in touch with your customers and build a relationship with them, which can lead
                        to increased customer retention rates.</li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Personalization.</strong> With Internet marketing, you can personalize offers to
                        customers based on their interests and purchase history, making it much more likely that you
                        will close a sale.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While it might be tempting to keep your digital marketing in-house, this is costly. Digital
                      marketing can be time-consuming and expensive. Outsourcing your digital marketing is a better
                      choice. Not only will outsourcing your digital marketing save you time, it's also much more
                      effective.</p>
                    <h5>Why Outsource Your Digital Marketing?</h5>
                    <p>Here are six reasons to outsource your digital marketing to a professional agency.</p>
                    <h3>Get a Team of Experts</h3>
                    <p>A good marketing campaign has a lot of moving parts. You need to consider design, copywriting,
                      social media, SEO, and market research, among many other factors. It's unlikely that a single
                      employee will have every skill that's required. In contrast, a full-service marketing agency can
                      handle all the marketing needs of your business. You'll have an entire team of experts ready to
                      help you.</p>
                    <h3>Keep Up With the Latest Trends</h3>
                    <p>The world of digital marketing is constantly changing, and changing fast. Are you prepared when
                      Google changes their algorithm, for example? A digital marketing firm will stay on top of the
                      latest trends, always updating their strategy to keep up with the market. You'll have access to
                      the latest digital marketing technology, and you'll be sure you're not wasting time on outdated
                      campaigns that don't deliver results. &nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Return On Investment</h3>
                    <p>Digital marketing agencies are invested in the success of your campaign. Agencies that do not
                      produce results don't stay in business. Your agency will work hard to continuously optimize your
                      digital marketing and deliver the best possible return on investment.</p>
                    <h3>Gain a Fresh Perspective</h3>
                    <p>You know your company better than anyone, it's often helpful to get an outsider's view of your
                      business. A digital marketing firm can offer a fresh perspective on how others view your company,
                      your brand, and your competition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Maintain Consistency</h3>
                    <p>Consistent messaging is one of the most important factors in the success of your digital
                      marketing. But this can be a challenge if your in-house staff need to take time off, or if their
                      attention is needed elsewhere. By outsourcing your digital marketing, you'll ensure that you
                      consistently meet your targets and deadlines. You won't have to worry about any gaps in messaging
                      because of staffing problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Lower Costs</h3>
                    <p>Hiring a new employee can be expensive. You'll need to pay your employee's salary in addition to
                      training and benefits&mdash;and there's no guarantee that your new hire will be the right fit for
                      you, or deliver the results you want. If you're hiring a whole team of people, those costs are
                      even higher. In addition to staff, your marketing department needs tools, such as analytics
                      software. Outsourcing your digital marketing gives you access to everything you need for a lower
                      cost.</p>

                  <div class="discriptionfull" style="display:none;">
                    <p>In this day and age, owning a small- or medium-sized business means you need to invest in a
                      website. In 2016 alone, online sales <a
                        href="https://marketingland.com/report-e-commerce-accounted-11-7-total-retail-sales-2016-15-6-2015-207088">grew
                        over 15%</a>. Experts expect this trend to continue. Investing in a website means you can snag a
                      growing portion of the market, a vital lifeline for smaller businesses. However, not many business
                      owners are also web developers. So, where do you start?</p>
                    <h5>Deciding You Need A Website: Custom-Built Or Use A Template?</h5>
                    <p>There are many reasons small- and medium-sized businesses choose to build a website. For initial
                      startup cost and perceived ease, many of those businesses decide to use a template for their
                      website. However, businesses that choose to use a custom-built website design often see more
                      long-term benefits. While the decision on which type of website design to use is entirely a
                      personal one, when you take the time to truly compare the costs and benefits of both website
                      designs, it quickly becomes apparent that money invested into a custom website design is money
                      well spent.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>5 Reasons You Should Choose Custom Website Designs</h5>
                    <h3>1. Custom designs are proven to be more effective than templates.&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>While true that custom designs have a higher initial cost and take a little longer to build than
                      a template, this investment is worth it. Custom designs are proven to have a higher return on
                      investment. These designs are tailored specifically to your business and its unique demands, which
                      allows you to prioritize targets and objectives, crushing your goals. Templates do not offer this
                      flexibility, which means you cannot take advantage of viral marketing. Overall, custom website
                      designs are more flexible and therefore more effective than templates.</p>
                    <h3>2. Custom designs offer greater scale-ability and control.</h3>
                    <p>Templates offer little in the way of control; they are not customize-able, have clunky controls
                      for the user, and tend to be less secure. You can avoid all of this by investing in a custom
                      design, which will work well when your business grows, allow you to customize your content and
                      aesthetic design, and ensure your customers' security.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>3. Custom designs stay relevant longer while offering a higher rate of return on your
                      investment.</h3>
                    <p>The average lifespan of a template is approximately 12-18 months, meaning you will be redesigning
                      quite soon. However, the average life cycle of a custom designed web page is between 3 and 4
                      years. Thus, the slightly higher initial cost actually ends up costing less over time. These
                      designs are also more stable; the familiarity of having the same basic design over several years
                      keeps customers engaged and results in better sales.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>4. Custom designs are automatically primed to maximize search engine optimization content while
                      serving mobile users.</h3>
                    <p>Templates often do not work well across multiple browsers and leave much to be desired for mobile
                      users. As smart phones increasingly become integrated into our lives, mobile searches become more
                      popular. Not catering to this demographic (who are also more inclined to purchase things online)
                      would be a terrible mistake. Additionally, you can easily control and change your SEO content,
                      keeping you relevant on search pages and driving more clients to your virtual doorstep.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>5. Custom designs offer credibility and lose fewer visitors due to a more integrated user
                      interface.&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>Templates are obvious, and they leech credibility from your business. Users who are easily able
                      to navigate a site will return to it, especially if the site offers built-in encryption to keep
                      their data safe. Custom designed websites offer a level of credibility and safety that templates
                      cannot.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>The Best Custom Website Design</h5>
